			<p>The CSS 3 specs suggest pseudo elements should include two colons, so p::first-line as opposed to p:first-line. This is to differentiate them with pseudo classes. Aiming for backwards-compatibility (whereby older web pages will still work in new browsers), browsers will still behave if they come across the single colon approach and this remains the best approach in most circumstances due to some older browsers not recognizing the double colon.</p>
